                    <p> If you're in the North, you most likely have a basement. A basement can be thought of as a really extruded crawl space foundation. Basements are popular in the East and in many older areas because they do provide additional space for the family. When a basement is converted into a living space it's possibly the least expensive way to expand the home.</p>

                    <p> If you're in the middle portion of the country, due to the frost lines not being quite as deep, you probably have a crawl space. A crawl space — or raised foundation — is a common type that you'll find in home construction. This foundation gets its name due to the fact that it's built above the ground, allowing for just enough room to crawl underneath. There are stem walls on the perimeters, pierced in-between and then a girder system and floor joists on top of that. The foundation is high enough to that you have at least 2' under there to crawl around to take care of the mechanical systems of the house.</p>

            	    <h3 class="subheader">Slab</h3>
                    <p> If you're down in the South, you probably have a slab. A slab foundation is usually concrete poured directly onto the ground. You would dig the perimeter footings and then you would also remove enough of the soil and grade so that you pour the slab and the footings at the same time. You typically find this type of foundation in a tract-home environment where they're building a lot of houses and it's more of a similar situation each time. It's very efficient and it's a cost savings to do it this way. Also, the soil conditions may prevent you from putting in a basement. This type of foundation is also different from other foundations in that it uses concrete — not wood — to help support the weight of the home.</p>
