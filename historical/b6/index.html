		   <h2>Super Fast</h2>
		   <p>Do you ever need that important package like yesterday? We're here for you. Though we're required by law to state time travel is impossible, you'll swear we drove a Delorean through time and space before you knew you wanted it.</p>
		   <p>Still not convinced?  We buy our cars from all the best Government auctions. Meaning? Our fleet of high performance and heavily modded street beasts spent their former lives as ex-con drug, gun and contra-band smuggling wagons. While we again have to say that to conduct these "said" operations is illegal, our liabilities fall under rule three. But we'll get to that soon enough.</p>
		   <p>In short, we want your business so bad that we'll get that item to you so fast that sometimes we have to toss it to you as we scream on by. Those sirens and lights you hear.. don't worry, that's our problem. No worries for you. Luring "the man" away is just another service we provide.</p>

		   <h2>Wicked Cheap</h2>
		   <p>Our workforce consists of up and coming professional drivers, stuntmen, and maybe the occasional ex-con wheel men. But hey, we're an equal opportunity employer. Who's to say who can't deliver a simple package from here to there. Not us.</p>
		   <p>Typical fees go to vehicle upkeep, driver wages, and legal team retainers. We pride ourselves on only 2% from each delivery. At GLD we focus helping you by keeping our overhead lower than the rims on a lowrider.</p>
		   <p>You got something? More than likely we'll take it. Cash? Heck yeah, we like the kind that jingles but prefer the kind that folds. Credit / ATM? Who doesn't, but hey, you're paying for the three percent fee. We also manage Greased Lightning Gold and Pawn, so break out that jewelry or set of golf clubs. We'll sell it to help finance your endeavors for a just a small percentage.</p>
		   <p>Other agencies will promise you all kinds of lies. We don't blow smoke up your business, we lay it out and you can take it or leave it. Don't think we can help you? Fine take your lousy hide somewhere else. BEAT IT!</p>

		   <h2>No Questions Asked</h2>
		   <p>We believe in the Golden Rule... you payin' with gold, you make the rule. We are a simple delivery service. We pick up your "package" and drop it off at the designated place. We don't cry like Brad Pitt on Seven "ooooh what's in the box" boo hoo this cry baby. We handle your business like the transporter. Just with more hair. Well long as it doesn't leak. Man, if your package leaks on my new pleather lining, you'd best move to the dark side of the moon son. 'Cuz that's just disrespectful and we know your momma taught you better.</p>
		   <p>Chances are, you won't even see the driver. All you'll see is the sweet smell of charred tires burning out of your drive way as you open your package with that feeling of childhood bliss. We even shuttle people around town. But they better be gagged or something because idle chat... get to know you....whatever else just isn't going to happen. You want to talk to someone, call a hotline or a shock therapist. We ain't got time to chit chat.
