              <h2>Archer Quotes</h2>
              <p>You better call Kenny Loggins. 'Cause you're in the danger zone.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying I invented the turtleneck. But I was the first person to realize its potential as a tactical garment. The tactical turtleneck! The... tactleneck!</p>

              <h2>Woodhouse Quotes</h2>
              <p>Let's liven things up, Burroughs. Five grams of junk says I can shoot a pina colada off your wife's head.</p>
              <p>For the Pimps and Ho's Ball I believe she said. Didn't seem the sort of place one takes a baby.</p>
              <p>Oh, I'll just yank his pants off, splash a lot of scotch and women's underthings about, and then tell him he slipped and fell chasing a terrified Asian prostitute out onto the patio. It's not the first time I've bashed his head in and had to cover my tracks. Happens three, four times a year.</p>

              <h2>Dr. Krieger Quotes</h2>
              <p>Give it time. This isn't the Flintstones. We can't just wang him in the head with a frying pan!</p>
              <p>You didn't think it was weird your chemo drugs were chewable?</p>
              <p>Iâ€™m sorry are you addressing me? Because your authority is not recognized in Fort Kickass.</p>
